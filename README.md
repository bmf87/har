# Human Activity Recognition (HAR)

Physical inactivity increases the risk of adverse health conditions like coronary heart disease, chronic conditions like poor blood circulation and clotting, type-2 diabetes, and the overall shortening of one's life expectancy. Machine Learning (ML) models leveraging inertial data *can* aid in the monitoring and encouraging of physical activity to prevent these. 

#### Purpose:
This repository contains source code for research leveraging raw inertial sensor data to predict human activity. The hyposthesis here is that we can simplify traditional HAR approaches that require extensive expertise in signal processing and feature engineering and use raw inertial sensor data to accurate predict low-intensity human activity.
